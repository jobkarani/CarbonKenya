        We work with project developers, follow on the progress and growth and finally market their verified carbon credits. Connecting
        African project developers to ready carbon credit buyers is our main goal.
        Providing a space where project developers could easily, efficiently and reliably trade their carbon credits through the ready buyers that we provide is our purpose.

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <h1>Ensure every African offseting project has a ready carbon market and every carbon buyer has ready, verified and secured carbon credits</h1>
      <p>
        Businesses and consumers leverage to create positive
        environmental change by removing the carbon generated by business
        activities. By choosing to buy from our platform directly, we can help you go greener,
        faster and more securely.
